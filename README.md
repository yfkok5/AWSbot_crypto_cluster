### Background

You were hired as a digital transformation consultant by one of the most prominent retirement plan providers in the country; they want to increase their client portfolio, especially by engaging young people. Since machine learning and NLP are disrupting finance to improve customer experience, you decide to create a robo advisor that could be used by customers or potential new customers to get investment portfolio recommendations for retirement.

In this homework assignment, you will combine your new Amazon Web Services skills with your already mastered Python superpowers, to create a bot that will recommend an investment portfolio for a retirement plan.

You are asked to accomplish the following main tasks:

1. **[Initial Robo Advisor Configuration:](#Initial-Robo-Advisor-Configuration)** Define an Amazon Lex bot with a single intent that establishes a conversation about the requirements to suggest an investment portfolio for retirement.

2. **[Build and Test the Robo Advisor](#Build-and-Test-the-Robo-Advisor):** Make sure that your bot is working and responding accurately along with the conversation with the user, by building and testing it.

3. **[Enhance the Robo Advisor with an Amazon Lambda Function:](#Enhance-the-Robo-Advisor-with-an-Amazon-Lambda-Function)** Create an Amazon Lambda function that validates the user's input and returns the investment portfolio recommendation. This task includes testing the Amazon Lambda function and making the integration with the bot.

### Instructions

#### Initial Robo Advisor Configuration

In this section, you will create the `RoboAdvisor` bot and add an intent with its corresponding slots.

Sign in into your AWS Management Console and [create a new custom Amazon Lex bot](https://console.aws.amazon.com/lex/home). Use the following parameters:

* **Bot name:** RoboAdvisor
* **Output voice**: Salli
* **Session timeout:** 5 minutes
* **Sentiment analysis:** No
* **COPPA**: No
* **Advanced options**: No
* *Leave default values for all other options.*

Create the `RecommendPortfolio` intent, and configure some sample utterances as follows (you can add more utterances as you wish):

* I want to save money for my retirement
* I'm ​`{age}​` and I would like to invest for my retirement
* I'm `​{age}​` and I want to invest for my retirement
* I want the best option to invest for my retirement
* I'm worried about my retirement
* I want to invest for my retirement
* I would like to invest for my retirement

This bot will use four slots, three using built-in types and one custom slot named `riskLevel`. Define the three initial slots as follows:


| Name             | Slot Type            | Prompt                                                                    |
| ---------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| firstName        | AMAZON.US_FIRST_NAME | Thank you for trusting me to help, could you please give me your name? |
| age              | AMAZON.NUMBER        | How old are you?                                                          |
| investmentAmount | AMAZON.NUMBER        | How much do you want to invest?                                           |

The `riskLevel` custom slot will be used to retrieve the risk level the user is willing to take on the investment portfolio. Create this custom slot as follows:

* Select the `+` icon next to 'Slot Types' in the 'Editor' on the left side of the screen.
* Choose `create custom slot` from the resulting display window.
* For **Slot type name**, type: riskLevel
* Select the radial dial button next to **Restrict to Slot values and synonyms**, then fill in the appropriate values and synonums. *Example*: Low, Minimal; High, Maximum.
* Click `Add slot to intent` when finished.

To format the response cards for the intent, click on the gear icon next to the intent as seen in the image below:

![gear_icon](Images/gear_icon.png)

Next, input the following data in the resulting display window:

* **Prompt:** What level of investment risk would you like to take?
* **Maximum number of retries:** 2
* **Prompt response cards:** 4

Configure the response cards for the `riskLevel` slot as is shown bellow:

| Card 1                              | Card 2                              |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| ![Card 1 sample](Images/card1.png)  | ![Card 2 sample](Images/card2.png)  |

| Card 3                              | Card 4                              |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| ![Card 3 sample](Images/card3.png)  | ![Card 4 sample](Images/card4.png)  |

**Note:** You can download free icons from [this website](https://www.iconfinder.com/) or you can use the icons provided in the [`Icons` directory](Icons/).

Move to the *Confirmation Prompt* section, and set the following messages:

* **Confirm:** Would you like me to search for the best investment portfolio for you now?
* **Cancel:** I will be pleased to assist you in the future.

Leave the error handling configuration for the `RecommendPortfolio` bot with the default values.

![Error handling configuration](Images/error_handling.png)

#### Build and Test the Robo Advisor

In this section, you will test your Robo Advisor. To build your bot, click on the `Build` button in the upper right hand corner. Once the build is complete, test it in the chatbot window. You should see a conversation like the one below.

![Robo Advisor test](Images/bot-test-no-lambda.gif)

#### Enhance the Robo Advisor with an Amazon Lambda Function

In this section, you will create an Amazon Lambda function that will validate the data provided by the user on the Robo Advisor. Start by creating a new lambda function from scratch and name it `recommendPortfolio`. Select Python 3.7 as runtime.

In the Lambda function, start by deleting the AWS generated default lines of code, then paste in the starter code provided in [lambda_function.py](Starter_Files/lambda_function.py) and complete the `recommend_portfolio()` function by following these guidelines:

##### User Input Validation

* The `age` should be greater than zero and less than 65.
* the `investment_amount` should be equal to or greater than 5000.

##### Investment Portfolio Recommendation

Once the intent is fulfilled, the bot should response with an investment recommendation based on the selected risk level as follows:

* **none:** "100% bonds (AGG), 0% equities (SPY)"
* **very low:** "80% bonds (AGG), 20% equities (SPY)"
* **low:** "60% bonds (AGG), 40% equities (SPY)"
* **medium:** "40% bonds (AGG), 60% equities (SPY)"
* **high:** "20% bonds (AGG), 80% equities (SPY)"
* **very high:** "0% bonds (AGG), 100% equities (SPY)"

Be creative while coding your solution, you can have all the code on the `recommend_portfolio()` function, or you can split the functionality across different functions, put your Python coding skills in action!

Once you finish coding your lambda function, test it using the [sample test cases](Test_Cases/) provided for this homework.

After successfully testing your code, open the Amazon Lex Console and navigate to the `RecommendPortfolio` bot configuration, integrate your new lambda function by selecting it in the _Lambda initialization and validation_ and _Fulfillment_ sections. Build your bot, and you should have a conversation as follows.

![Robo Advisor test with Lambda](Images/bot-test-with-lambda.gif)

### Submission

You should create a brand new repository in GitHub and upload the following files to your repo.

* A python script with your final lambda function.

* From the Amazon Lex Console, export your bot, intent, and slot using `Amazon Lex` as the target platform, and upload the ZIP files to your repo.

* Create a short video or animated GIF showing a demo of your Robo Advisor in action from the test window. Upload the video or animated GIF file to your repo.

Once you have uploaded all the files into the repo, post a link to your homework's repository in BootCamp Spot.

### Hints

* Make sure your intent and slot names are named correctly in your Lambda code.  The names in Lex should match the names in Lambda exactly:

![Lex_Names1](Images/Lex_names1.png)
![Lex_Names2](Images/Lex_names2.png)

* You may have to refresh the Lex intent page after creating the custom slot and the lambda function in order to see them in the options.

### Background

You are a Senior Manager at the Advisory Services team on a [Big Four firm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Four_accounting_firms). One of your most important clients, a prominent investment bank, is interested in offering a new cryptocurrencies investment portfolio for its customers, however, they are lost in the immense universe of cryptocurrencies. They ask you to help them make sense of it all by generating a report of what cryptocurrencies are available on the trading market and how they can be grouped using classification.  

In this homework assignment, you will put your new unsupervivsed learning and Amazon SageMaker skills into action by clustering cryptocurrencies and creating plots to present your results.

You are asked to accomplish the following main tasks:

* **[Data Preprocessing](#Data-Preprocessing):** Prepare data for dimension reduction with PCA and clustering using K-Means.

* **[Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA](#Reducing-Data-Dimensions-Using-PCA):** Reduce data dimension using the `PCA` algorithm from `sklearn`.

* **[Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-Means](#Clustering-Cryptocurrencies-Using-K-Means):** Predict clusters using the cryptocurrencies data using the `KMeans` algorithm from `sklearn`.

* **[Visualizing Results](#Visualizing-Results):** Create some plots and data tables to present your results.

* **[Optional Challenge](#Optional-Challenge):** Deploy your notebook to Amazon SageMaker.

### Instructions

#### Data Preprocessing

In this section, you will load the information about cryptocurrencies and perform data preprocessing tasks.  You can choose one of the following methods to load the data:

1. Using the provided `CSV` file, create a `Path` object and read the file data directly into a DataFrame named `crypto_df` using `pd.read_csv()`.

2. Using the following `requests` library, retreive the necessary data from the following API endpoint from _CryptoCompare_ - `https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/data/all/coinlist`.  __HINT:__ You will need to use the 'Data' key from the json response, then transpose the DataFrame. Name your DataFrame `crypto_df`.

With the data loaded into a Pandas DataFrame, continue with the following data preprocessing tasks.

3. Keep only the necessary columns: 'CoinName','Algorithm','IsTrading','ProofType','TotalCoinsMined','TotalCoinSupply'

4. Keep only the cryptocurrencies that are trading.

5. Keep only the cryptocurrencies with a working algorithm.

6. Remove the `IsTrading` column.

7. Remove all cryptocurrencies with at least one null value.

8. Remove all cryptocurrencies that have no coins mined.

9. Drop all rows where there are 'N/A' text values.

10. Store the names of all cryptocurrencies in a DataFrame named `coins_name`, use the `crypto_df.index` as the index for this new DataFrame.

11. Remove the `CoinName` column.

12. Create dummy variables for all the text features, and store the resulting data in a DataFrame named `X`.

13. Use the [`StandardScaler` from `sklearn`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler.html) to standardize all the data of the `X` DataFrame. Remember, this is important prior to using PCA and K-Means algorithms.

#### Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA

Use the [`PCA` algorithm from `sklearn`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.decomposition.PCA.html) to reduce the dimensions of the `X` DataFrame down to three principal components.

Once you have reduced the data dimensions, create a DataFrame named `pcs_df` using as columns names `"PC 1", "PC 2"` and `"PC 3"`;  use the `crypto_df.index` as the index for this new DataFrame.

You should have a DataFrame like the following:

![pcs_df](Images/pcs_df.png)

#### Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-Means

In this section, you will use the [`KMeans` algorithm from `sklearn`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.KMeans.html) to cluster the cryptocurrencies using the PCA data.

Perform the following tasks:

1. Create an Elbow Curve to find the best value for `k` using the `pcs_df` DataFrame.

2. Once you define the best value for `k`, run the `Kmeans` algorithm to predict the `k` clusters for the cryptocurrencies data. Use the `pcs_df` to run the `KMeans` algorithm.

3. Create a new DataFrame named `clustered_df`, that includes the following columns `"Algorithm", "ProofType", "TotalCoinsMined", "TotalCoinSupply", "PC 1", "PC 2", "PC 3", "CoinName", "Class"`. You should maintain the index of the `crypto_df` DataFrames as is shown bellow.

    ![clustered_df](Images/clustered_df.png)

#### Visualizing Results

In this section, you will create some data visualization to present the final results. Perform the following tasks:

1. Create a scatter plot using `hvplot.scatter`, to present the clustered data about cryptocurrencies having `x="TotalCoinsMined"` and `y="TotalCoinSupply"` to contrast the number of available coins versus the total number of mined coins. Use the `hover_cols=["CoinName"]` parameter to include the cryptocurrency name on each data point.

2. Use `hvplot.table` to create a data table with all the current tradable cryptocurrencies. The table should have the following columns: `"CoinName", "Algorithm", "ProofType", "TotalCoinSupply", "TotalCoinsMined", "Class"`


### Optional Challenge

For the challenge section, you have to upload your Jupyter notebook to Amazon SageMaker and deploy it.

The `hvplot` library is not included in the built-in anaconda environments, so for this challenge section, you should use the `altair` library instead.

Perform the following tasks:

1. Upload your Jupyter notebook and rename it as `crypto_clustering_sm.ipynb`

2. Select the `conda_python3` environment.

3. Install the `altair` library by running the following code before the initial imports.

  ```python
  !pip install -U altair
  ```

4. Use the `altair` scatter plot to create the Elbow Curve.

5. Use the `altair` scatter plot to visualize the clusters. Since this is a 2D-Scatter, use `x="PC 1"` and `y="PC 2"` for the axes, and add the following columns as tool tips: `"CoinName", "Algorithm", "TotalCoinsMined", "TotalCoinSupply"`.

6. Use the `altair` scatter plot to visualize the tradable cryptocurrencies using  `x="TotalCoinsMined"` and `y="TotalCoinSupply"` for the axes.

7. Show the table of current tradable cryptocurrencies using the `display()` command.

8. Remove all `hvplot` references from your code.
